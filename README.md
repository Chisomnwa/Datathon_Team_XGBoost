# School Data Warehouse Project Documentation

## Project Overview

### Background

FGC Ilorin recently experienced concerning statistics in their 2024 WASSCE results. Only **56.78%** of their students achieved five credits or more, including passes in Mathematics and English. Recognizing this, the school consulted us to dive deep into the issue and create a data-driven solution to improve students' academic performance. 

Find the statistics [here](https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2016/08/RESULT-STATISTICS-FOR-MAY-JUNE-2015-WASSCE-SUMMARY-FOR-FEDERAL-UNITY-SCHOOLS.pdf)


With the upcoming JAMB and WASSCE exams, our objective was to not only analyze the factors influencing poor performance but also to proactively provide insights that would lead to a better result in the future. We designed and implemented an end-to-end solution to help the school leverage data to improve performance in these crucial examinations.

## How We Carried Out the Project
### 1. Data Generation
Since the school lacked a foundational data infrastructure, we simulated a dataset that reflects the key aspects of the African educational ecosystem. The data generation plan was carried out using a Python script (`data_generation.py` and `academic_performance.py`) to simulate realistic data for the various entities in the system.

- **Student bio-data** (e.g., age, gender, admission number)
- **Parentsâ€™ demographic data** (e.g., income level, occupation, education level)
- **Resource allocation** (e.g., library usage, lab usuage)
- **Extra-curricular activities** (e.g., clubs and sports participation)
- **Historical exam performance** (e.g., exam scores)
- **Staff Bio-data** (e.g., exam scores)

## Data Warehouse Design

The data warehouse is structured into **dimension tables** and **fact tables**, following a star schema for efficient querying and reporting. The primary dimensions store descriptive information about the entities, while the fact tables capture transactional data that tracks events like attendance, academic performance, and resource usage.

## Data Modeling Overview

In this project, we designed a data model that organizes the school's data into relevant tables, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis. The model includes tables for student performance, extracurricular activities, and resource usage, among others. Each table has carefully defined relationships, enabling a comprehensive view of each student's academic journey and resource engagement.

The diagram below illustrates the structure of our data model, highlighting the relationships between key entities:

![Data Modeling Diagram](diagram.png)

As shown, we establish foreign key relationships between fact and dim tables like `FactAcademicPerformance`, `ExtraCurricularActivities`, and `ResourceUsage`, ensuring data consistency and supporting powerful cross-table queries for insights.
